	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the use of wearable sensors for providing affect-based adaptation in Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems. We begin with discussion of selected issues regarding the applications of affective computing techniques. We describe our experiments for affect change detection with a range of wearable devices, such as wristbands and the BITalino platform, and discuss an original software solution, which we developed for this purpose. Furthermore, as a test-bed application for our work, we selected computer games. We discuss the state-of-the-art in affect-based adaptation in games, described in terms of the so-called affective loop. We present our original proposal of a conceptual design framework for games, called the affective game design patterns. As a proof-of-concept realization of this approach, we discuss some original game prototypes, which we have developed, involving emotion-based control and adaptation. Finally, we comment on a software framework, that we have previously developed, for context-aware systems which uses human emotional contexts. This framework provides means for implementing adaptive systems using mobile devices with wearable sensors.},

In our work we focus on the applications of affective techniques in the design of video games. We assume that a change in the affective condition of a player can be detected based on the monitoring of physiological signals following the James-Lange theory of emotions. We propose the use of game design patterns introduced by Björk and Holopainen to build games. We identify a set of patterns that can be considered affective. Then we demonstrate how these patterns can be used in a design of a scroll-runner game. We address the problem of the calibration of measurements in order to reﬂect responses of individual users. We also provide results of practical experiments to verify our approach.},

In serious games playing contexts, real-time assessment of the player’s emotional state is crucially important to enable an emotion-driven adaptation during gameplay. In addition, a personalized assessment and adaptation based on the player's characteristics remains a challenge for serious games designers.This paper presents a generic and efficient emotion-driven approach for personalized assessment and adaptation in serious games, in which two main methods and their algorithms are proposed. The first one is a method for assessing, in real time, the player's emotion taking into account the personality type and the playing style of the player.The second one is an emotion-driven personalized adaptation method based on Markov modeling of dependency between the serious game events and the change in the player's emotional state. Therefore, the proposed approach has been evaluated by playing an affective vs. non-affective version of a serious game that we have developed to illustrate the applicability of the above-mentioned methods. The overall results showed that owing to our approach, a serious game become able to enhance its adaptivity toward playing outcomes and improve its overall playability.},

The results of the analysis performed in this paper present applicable methods for each type of emotion and their intensity and propose their classification. The classification of emotion sensors is presented to reveal area of application and expected outcomes from each method, as well as their limitations. This paper should be relevant for researchers using human emotion evaluation and analysis, when there is a need to choose a proper method for their purposes or to find alternative decisions.

Physiological signal is an effective modality that can provide a better understanding of the emotional states and is very promising to be applied to affective gaming. Most physiological-based affective gaming applications evaluate player’s emotion on an overall game fragment. These approaches fail to capture the emotion change in the dynamic game context. In order to achieve a better understanding of psychophysiological response with a better time sensitivity, we present a study that evaluates the psychophysiological responses related to the game events. More speciﬁcally, we present a multi-modal database DAG that contains peripheral physiological signals (ECG, EDA, respiration, EMG, temperature), accelerometer signals, facial and screening recordings as well as player’s self-reported eventrelated emotion assessment through game playing. We then investigate physiological-based emotion detection and recognition by using machine learning techniques. Common challenges for physiological-based affective model such as signal segmentation, feature normalization, relevant features are addressed. We also discuss factors that inﬂuence the performance of the affective models.},

We conducted a study of subjects playing the game Tetris in varying difficulty levels, leading to boredom, stress, and flow. Using a convolutional neural network, we achieve an accuracy of 70\% in recognizing flow-inducing levels.

	abstract = {Web-based knowledge systems support an impressive and growing amount of information. Among the difficulties faced by these systems is the problem of overwhelming the user with a vast amount of data, often referred to as information overload. The problem has escalated with the ever increasing issues of time constraints and the extensive use of handheld devices. The use of context is one possible way out helping with this situation. To provide a more robust approach to context gathering we propose the use of Social Web technologies alongside the Semantic Web. As the social web is heavily used it could provide a better understanding of a user’s interests and intentions. The proposed system gathers information about users from their social web identities and enriches it with ontological knowledge. Thus an interest model for the user can be created which can serve as a good source of contextual knowledge. This work bridges the gap between the user and system searches by analyzing the virtual existence of a user and making interesting recommendations accordingly.},

	abstract = {Pokémon GO is a location-based augmented reality mobile game based on the Pokémon franchise. After the game was launched globally in July 2016, it quickly became the most successful mobile game in both popularity and revenue generation at the time, and the first location-based augmented reality game to reach a mainstream status. We explore the game experiences through a qualitative survey (n=1000) in Finland focusing on the positive and the negative aspects of Pokémon GO as told by the players. The positive experiences are related to movement, sociability, game mechanics, and brand while the negative experiences emerge from technical problems, unequal gaming opportunities, bad behavior of other players and nonplayers, and unpolished game design. Interestingly, the augmented reality features, safety issues or the free-to-play revenue model did not receive considerable feedback. The findings are useful for academics and industry practitioners for studying and designing location-based augmented reality game experiences.},

	abstract = {Playing videogames is a process driven by both cognitive and emotional factors. Then, developing a mechanism that takes into account players’ emotional state for adapting specific game features is a way to increase their engagement and flow during gameplay. In this paper, we present how a passive Brain Computer Interface (BCI) can be used to assess the state of mind of a player that can be used for enhancing his experience through adaptation. In particular, we collected data from EEG signals, in a horror adventure game, to learn a model of flow by monitoring the level of boredom, flow, and stress of the player. To this aim, we set an experiment and collected both subjective data about the perceived emotions and state of flow and data from the BCI that have been used to learn a classifier to recognize and assess the player’s affective state. Results are encouraging and the learned model achieves a good accuracy in distinguishing the three player’s states.},

	abstract = {The UX domain has so far been strongly associated with software development. However, its methods are finding their way into domains like Product and Service Design. Product Designers now need competencies far beyond classical form-giving. The objective of this paper is to show Product Designers which design dimensions they need to attend to when designing for UX. The paper gives an overview of design dimensions that potentially impact how users’ experience products. These dimensions are brought together from theories of Cognitive Science, models of Human-Computer Interaction and findings from Design Research. They are presented under four categories: dimensions of human perception, dimensions of products, dimensions of the context of use and the temporal dimension. In the final part, the identified dimensions are connected into a schema, illustrating their interplay and therefore the journey of UX between a user and a product, in a certain context over a certain time.},
